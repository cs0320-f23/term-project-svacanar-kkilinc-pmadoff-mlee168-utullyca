## RACE - Building Distributed Actor Systems

The *Runtime for Airspace Concept Evaluation* (RACE) is a software architecture and framework to
build configurable, highly concurrent and distributed message based systems. Among other things,
RACE can be used to rapidly build simulations that span several machines (including synchronized
displays), interface existing hardware simulators and other live data feeds, and incorporate
sophisticated visualization components such as NASAâ€™s [WorldWind](https://goworldwind.org/) viewer.

RACE is implemented as a distributed [actor system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) built
on top of the [Akka](http://akka.io/) framework, primarily uses [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
as programming language and runs within Java Virtual Machines.
