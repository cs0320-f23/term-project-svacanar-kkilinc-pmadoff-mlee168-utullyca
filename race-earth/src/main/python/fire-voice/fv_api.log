There's a, um, wildfure? No, I mean, wildfire near the woods behind the house! It's spreading really fast! Please hurry! Are you safe? Is everyone in the house safe? How many people are in immediate danger? I need to assess the level of safety and urgency for the responding units. Please let me know. I apologize if there is some background noise, it's quite chaotic right now. I'm doing my best to stay focused. Just gather yourself and take a deep breath. We will get through this. Okay, I need you to stay calm and follow my instructions. First, I want you to evacuate the house immediately and make your way to a safe distance from the fire. Do not attempt to put out the fire yourself. I repeat, do not attempt to put out the fire. Please keep yourself and others away from the fire. Are there any nearby fire hydrants that the firefighters can use? This will help them in their efforts to extinguish the flames. Can you see any? If not, don't worry, the fire department will handle it. I understand that this is an incredibly stressful situation. Help is on the way, and I want you to know that we are doing everything we can to get there as quickly as possible. Just stay calm and let the firefighters handle the situation. They are trained professionals and they will take care of you. Please continue to update me on any changes or developments in the situation. The fire department is on its way, and they will arrive as soon as possible. Stay safe and try to remain calm."
